# NOVASTACK

## Design Rationale

The NovaStack website is built with a mobile-first approach to ensure seamless responsiveness across all devices. I used a clean, modern layout with Tailwind CSS to enhance readability and visual hierarchy. Key components like buttons and cards are modular for easy maintenance and reusability. Color schemes and typography were chosen to convey professionalism and brand consistency. Subtle animations and hover effects improve interactivity without distracting the user. Overall, the design balances aesthetics, usability, and performance.
